Subject: [PATCH 1/9] tests: install test programs

--enable-install-test-programs allows cross compiling test programs
and installing them to $bindir.  This configure option propagates to
Makefile.am as HAVE_INSTALL_TESTS.

This was set for basic tests (modetest, etc.), but the tests/
directory was missed.
